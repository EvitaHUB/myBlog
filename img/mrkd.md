##Markdown

**Markdown** is a lightweight markup language with plain-text-formatting syntax, created in 2004 by John Gruber and Aaron Swartz. Markdown is often used for formatting readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor. [^see note below]

The language is easy to use and one can practice maximum simplicity.
Previously I have never done academic text typing on pc. yes I`m old and got my previous master 20 years ago and that involved good old early MS Word :) But it worked for primary formatting and references.


Now I use [**Atom**](https://atom.io/) and I learn every time. Still some problems with image adding. But there is very nice preview and lot of possibilities with packages.

I would have loved to have all this info before our Big Data analysis course last spring. Then I would try to gather all my final research data in one place.
Ok, I will not go in details and repeat how to use all formatting, just will add a [**Markdown cheat-sheat**](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf) for future use.


During the course Intro to Digital Humanities we had a task to markdown an image of text. Below you can see
